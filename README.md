# Particles

Particles is a web-based simulation platform designed to explore and visualize the dynamics of graphs and particles. The project consists of two main sub-projects: Graph Playground and Particle Life. Both sub-projects share the same base simulation code and are built using JavaScript, HTML, Bootstrap, and CSS.

## Graph Playground
Graph Playground is an educational tool for learning about graph theory and graphing algorithms. It allows users to:

- **Create Graphs**: Generate graphs from premade templates or define your own custom graph.
- **Simulate Interactions**: Play around with various simulation parameters like forces between nodes, friction, gravity, and more.
- **Force-Directed Layout**: Visualize graphs using a force-directed approach.
- **Pause and Analyze**: Pause the simulation to run and visualize k-means clustering and Dijkstra’s algorithm on the graph.

## Particle Life
Particle Life is a simulation that explores the emergent behavior of particles under simple interaction rules. The key features include:

- **Diverse Particle Types**: Particles are categorized by different types (colors), each with specified forces of attraction or repulsion to other particles.
- **Non-Newtonian Dynamics**: The simulation does not adhere to Newton’s 3rd law; for example, Particle A can attract Particle B, while Particle B repels Particle A, leading to unique and interesting behaviors.
- **Emergent Phenomena**: These rules create dynamic interactions where “life-like” behavior seems to emerge from the particles.

Particle life is not an original idea. More can be found on particle life [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4YirERTVF0&t=136s)
